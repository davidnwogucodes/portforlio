        <h2>about-me:$<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
        <p>
          Over the past few years, I’ve built and led backend solutions across fintech, logistics, and SaaS platforms — from secure payment APIs and virtual card systems to delivery infrastructure and dynamic content tools. I’ve worked with amazing teams to ship features that boosted performance, improved reliability, and made life easier for users (and developers).

I enjoy building things that just work — clean, modular architectures, efficient workflows, and resilient systems that scale gracefully. Whether it’s designing a microservice, optimizing a database, or debugging a late-night deploy, I’m all about making the backend feel effortless.

When I’m not deep in code, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech stacks, mentoring junior devs, or figuring out how to make something run just a little faster.
